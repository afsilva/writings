The Lighthouse

Lost at sea
Alone on the waves
Distant from land
Seasick on the surface


Wet from the rain
Burnt from the sun
Cold from the wind
Hungry and tired


The silence is maddening
The blue is blinding
The white is comforting
The horizon is promising


At night, there is no rest
At light, there is no task


Where is the lighthouse?
Light to the path of salvation
Bright flash of hope
In the midst of nothing
