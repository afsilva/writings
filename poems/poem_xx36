What does one say to the gone?
Wake up! Wake up! It's dawn.
How does one cope with who stay?
Today, broken like a vase of clay


From a distance, I imagine
A mother's cry
Lost in her humanity
Upon the death of insanity


God have mercy on her
Help us overcome the blur
Don't forsake the gone
Hoping will mourn upon


* Dedicated to my uncle Hudson Cordeiro de Farias who passed away this afternoon.
