Insipid

I ask my mind
to let me feel
I close my eyes
to escape this real


I look around
trying to hear
Anything different
instead of fear


I am not afraid
I am not stressed
I can't do charade
I am just blessed


I don't feel anything
from the shoulders up
I just fell asleep
in this write up


Who's going to read this?
Does anyone care?
I don't
Hard, even to put it in prayer


Maybe someday I will look back
And see a life that is like broken salt
Yet not out of whack


Just insipid, that's all.
