To mom

Her story is an epic
Her journey full of pain
She’s been there for us
Carrying our chain


She loved us
Unconditionally
Brought us up
To be ourselves


Told us fun stories
Sang us some songs
Kept us safe
Taught us right and wrong


She loves me
with word, discipline
hug and kiss
She was my bliss


Every night ready to bless
A prayer she says
For her kids in bed


Childhood memories
Like no other
I will always have
Because of my mother
