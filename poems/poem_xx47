Well

A gaze in darkness opens the well with my soul
The morning prison where labels are not criminal
Separated by miles of asphalted moat


A well so deep, it distracts us from solitude
The work of others who excuse themselves
The cry of mothers who can't provide


Damaged knowledge by cultures' clash
A well so shallow, it can't  be used
Contaminated water with the past's ash


Meaningless duty of apparent necessity
Alone in a crowd of blessed hands
Cursed by a life of morals and stands


Make a wish on this drying well
With abstract words that we can't spell
And when it dries, wake up and live
