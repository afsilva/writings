Legacy

You say ‘mom’
You say ‘dad’
You write your name
You learn to add


You grow up
I grow old
You get smart
I learn to fold


You graduate
Go to college
I stay
With past knowledge


You find a wife
that you love
I learned in life
To let go of


I see you again
A weird flashback
Grandkids to entertain
Time for a snack


I’ve lived, now I’m old
With no secrets untold
A fine legacy I leave
On life’s eternal eve
