What's left to gain?

I am tired of thinking so hard
Another story in my head
Feeds another fear in my heart


The next that never comes
Is what we live and die for
For tomorrow's yesterday
was already wasted by us


I refuse to rhyme to meet form
Accidental, the perfect storm
With not much left to gain
But with everything to lose


A nod, a smile, "How's it going?"
You say it through your mask
It's just a game. C'mon, never quit
You know I'm tired. Tag! You are it.
