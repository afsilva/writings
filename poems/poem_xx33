A Prayer

I don't know where to begin.
It seems we haven't talked in a while.
Like friends that move away, and grow apart
Placing the relationship in life-support via the phone,
And talking about the same superficial subjects
During every conversation: "How's the weather?"


I don't need fancy words to talk to You
I just need words and a will to open up


You've got to understand that I live in a time
Where distances have been minimized.
I can talk to someone across the world
I can get an education without leaving my bed
I can order food, clothes, and entertainment
Without having' to move


I want to be moved by You
I want to run towards Your arms
I want to go to Your house everyday
I want proximity


But, I know that I am not moving
I need You to come and knock on my door
Call out my name, so I know without a doubt
That You miss me, I already know you love me


Come, and tell me what is right
Yell at me when I do wrong
I can't learn if everything I do
Has already been 'forgiven and forgotten'


Remind me of my doings, so I can do
What is right over and over again
And what is wrong I can be ashamed
And hopefully learn my lesson.


I'd rather have tough love
Than feel like this.
A feeling that everything is relative
And it is up to my understanding of reality
To decide what is right or wrong


Come, ring the doorbell.
Walk into my heart unannounced.
Rearrange my furniture.
Take away my possessions,
So, I can focus on our friendship.


I miss You, and I hope You can still hear me
