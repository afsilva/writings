Finding the pieces that will fit on our puzzle of truth
It is more incomplete now than in my youth


What you seek and what I look for are not the same
I want life change and you want someone to blame


I think, I might even say what  I believe
But the do is what's hard to achieve


Does it make me a liar? Does it mean I am bad?
Or maybe I am just human, you know, just a tad


What is between your birth and death
That really matters while we've got breath


There is no time to be afraid, no time to regret
Love, learn, teach and keep away from debt


What else is left to say that hasn't be said?
No more written words left unread
