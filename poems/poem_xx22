Optical Illusion [Part I]

When nobody is looking
My core is exposed
Vulnerable to the One




Just because I keep telling myself
It doesn’t mean it is real tonight
There is a concrete wall in my brain
Dividing my abstract existence




Take me away from these boundaries
Kidnap me from myself at once
Remove me from our putrid culture
Lure this heart into love
Erase the footprints of life




Bring me to the place I call home
Ransom my will from myself
Repel my thoughts from wandering
Compose the symphony of life




So many words, yet meaningless
So much dualism, yet immeasurable
So many faces, yet no smiles




Does anyone even…
