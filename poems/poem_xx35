Rest

Breathes in, breathes out.


I start in the sleepiness of the morning
While melting in the heat of the day
A hunger for a meal I'm already eating


I ride the distance
between gratefulness
and weariness


I sit and stare
I think and sigh
Bits flows through


The occasional chat
A seldom laugh
An immutable constant


I end in the sleepiness of the evening
While cooling in the breeze of the night
Still a hunger for the untouched meaning


Breathes in, breathes out.


The burden I try carrying myself
Brings me to nowhere
It needs to be cast upon
The One who can give me rest


Jesus said: "Come to me,
all you who are weary
and burdened, and
I will give you rest."
