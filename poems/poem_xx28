Nocturnal Angst

Like a vampire who dreads the sun
I lay right awake fearing the night
I search for a tear deep inside
With eyes like a desert yet alive


I understand the symptoms
I can't diagnose the anomaly
Is it in me? Is it me?
Maybe it is what I've become


I stare at the possibilities of tomorrow
In a night where facts are no longer relevant
I overhear silence's whisper in my ear
While embracing hope's warm certainty


That a strangers' company is welcomed
And soon the weight of exhaustion will arrive
While merging these words into a dream
Washed away in the dawn of day
