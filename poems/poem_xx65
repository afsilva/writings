Redemption of one is simple
When one is two
How do they mingle?


I've seen you at your best
Standing up for us
Winning on the test


Looking to the far East
I now realize you are
Just a furious beast


Hungry and ready to devour
the devout with no power


Soul sold out
Cold cop out
Stock stuck out


Because I am a prisoner
In this cage, I am safe
From you


For how long?
