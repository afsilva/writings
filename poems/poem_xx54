Busy Lousy Lazy Love

Busy is the name of the fight
Lousy is what we try to hide


Lazy is motivated by money
Love is confused with honey


My beliefs, irrelevant to you
Your pain numbed by two


Busy is the friend of greed
Lousy is sentiment of speed


Lazy is gentle and slow
Love is not a show.


Your beliefs, I try to respect
My pain is mostly regret
