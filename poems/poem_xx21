Be My Alarm Clock

Keep me awake for simplicity’s sake
I can’t take you for granted anymore
Where’s the antidote for life’s ache?
Unchain me from myself, I implore


This dream that I live in right now
is the nightmare everybody talks about
Wake me up! Don’t let me sleep!
The simple things of life I want to keep


Talk to me, come in this room!
Let me hear your awakening boom
I have to get up! No more lying down
Wasting and watching my life drown


God, I am listening if you talk
Because I am no more, You are alone
Fulfill my life throughout our walk
And awaken this diseased heart of stone
