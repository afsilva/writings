When in doubt

Life is a sentence that ends on a query
If the reward is not what will it be
But the opportunity for what it was
How can we proclaim victory over her
And yet do everything we can to avoid it
Will I be afraid when my turn arrives?
What about the loved ones left behind?


Life without death is music to the deaf


How should I approach the ailing?
Should we cry with the ones who weep?
Should we regret past choices made?
Or embrace the fact that it is never too late?
Get on or off your soapbox of beliefs and values
Respect a wish or enforce unconditional hope
Quietly sit there, waiting, loving, crying


Life gazes at death until its final breath
