The Days

I miss the days, it was just you and I.
The privilege of being firstborn.
I miss the days, it was just you and I.
The privilege of brotherly love.
I miss the days, it was just you and I.
The privilege of discovering friendship.
I miss the days, it was just you and I.
The privilege of reaching love.
I miss the days, it was just you and I.
The privilege of being found.
I miss the days, it was just you and I.
The privilege of rebelling against the old.
I miss the days, it was just you and I.
The privilege of widening my horizons.
I miss the days, it was just you and I.
The privilege of kissing the bride.
I miss the days, it was just you and I.
The privilege of having a firstborn.
I miss the days, it was just you and I.
The privilege of having a newborn.


The days keep coming
and I keep missing them.
