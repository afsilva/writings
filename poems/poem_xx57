Bedtime

Wait, I don't want to rhyme
Listen, I hate that chime


I gaze upon the light
When things aren't right


Quietly, having to watch him sick
Neglecting Time's curse with the stick


Alone in the congregation
With no words nor visitation


An invisible, tasteless mess
My sorrows I must confess


Much is never enough
I'd rather cry than be tough


Tired of denying my want
A fake, unoriginal flaunt


I'm broken with content
Contrite, Did I repent?


Above they sleep
Down here, I weep


Tomorrow is always the Hope
Of today's downward slope


I am trying to stop
The mentality of swap


Give it so I can't take
Surely, I must forsake


A paradoxical culture
Being eaten by vultures


Existential peace I can only find
On the One, who loves mankind
