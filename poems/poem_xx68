Awaken at night with nothing to say
Another key stroke after a work day


Craving caffeine and being allergic
The sun coming up, feeling lethargic


In twelve minutes I must end
I just need rhymes before hitting send


Do not be hypnotized by the set
Get up, walk, move, break a sweat


Where will I be five years from now?
Maybe a hi or a hello or even a ciao


Five minutes to go, what do I do?
Find the remote because nothing is new
