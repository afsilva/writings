Regret

There is a fear that consumes me
Of looking back for another try
And to avoid such haunting, you see,
I live life constraining my sigh


In this life, there isn't much I regret
Born into blessings
Without wants, protected,
Unaware of even a threat


If I give up without trying
Eventually my fear
Regret will visit
And see me crying


I live my now
And every so often
I look for what's ahead
Delighted on our vow


I constantly fear regret
Not for my own sake
But for theirs
Who aren't men yet


Yet fear is motivation
Living life without much sigh
Avoiding regret
And kissing it goodbye
