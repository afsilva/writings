Two Thousand and Eleven
Possibly to forget
It could've been heaven
But not there yet


For some life goes on
For others was a close
My feats were a yawn
No beauty like a rose


Greed, nothing but smoke
Happiness, misused as a word
Religion, taken as a joke
Politics, completely absurd


Two Thousand and Twelve
Not much should change
Common sense to shelve
Our patience derange


Entitled to things
We think is right
While living as kings
And dying without sight


Peace, I wish to you
Love, He gave to us
Forgiveness, journey anew
Health, definitely a plus


-- Happy New Year!
