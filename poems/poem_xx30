Mes

I have a me who wants to buy
Another me who wants to sell
Yet another who wants to give
A me who doesn't want to die
The me who wants to yell
And one who needs to forgive


With so many 'mes,' which me
Should I trust? Which me
Should I follow? Which me
Is really me?


I don't know.
