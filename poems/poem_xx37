My Worst Enemy

How can I pray
When my mind goes astray
Where my mind wants to be
My body won't agree


I close my eyes to image love
And I end up dozing off
I must get out of the couch
But have nobody to vouch


I need to run more
Eat less
Breathe more
Stress
less


I want to learn
without having to earn
I want to live
I want to give


I want to look at the mirror
I want to see me clearer
Alive and well
Not fighting myself
