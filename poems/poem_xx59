Do Birds Cry?

The elegance of flight
To feed your spawn
Creation's might
Laboring since dawn


Is it just nature?
Can we call it love?
Instinct to nurture
Inspired by above


I wish you could know
All of the four are fine
But now it is time to go
And our paths untwine


Author notes
our bathroom vent has a cover that only opens when the vent is on or sometimes when it is windy outside it will flip... some hose this bird was able to get in there, my guess is back sometime in march... Joanna heard some noise in the ceiling... eventually I heard it too... at night sounded like mice walking around, during the day you could hear the tweets :-)... So, last week, I got outside early, and finally found out what was going on... This little mama bird is a rock star... She could only get into the vent (aka nest) when we turned on the vent, if we didn't she would just try literally all day long to fly into the vent until it was open... Once she was in she could get out by pushing on it, but not the other way around... I didn't have a ladder long enough to reach the top of the house so I called Wildlife removal... they came... took the birds o! ut, cleaned off the nest, and put the guard on all 3 vents we have... This was about 2 hours ago... mamma bird still outside right now, trying to get it in... with a lot of patience and elegance... The little birds will be taken tomorrow morning to some sort of organization that will take care of them until they can fly way... Tomorrow morning, I am going to look for mamma bird and she if she has given up yet.
