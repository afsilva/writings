to live

virtual cash
tacit gain
real trash
actual pain


changes abroad
ditto within
living fraud
cynic grin


failing the test
receiving a degree
pretending the best
drifting at sea


flaccid success
all pursue
placid distress
none construe


reality we speak of
randomly precise
believe in Love
and live twice
