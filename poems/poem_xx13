In Memory [9/11]

I was coming out of my first graduate course
When my peers at work started looking for a source
All of them were slow or totally down
Millions of people were searching for that town


International sites were the only ones I could find
I had never seen the WWW so undefined
I finally saw a picture that didn’t make much sense
Something had hit that building so immense


The TV at work was finally turned on
Everyone dropped their tasks and asked:
What the hell is going on?


For hours we watched in disbelief
That a human could carry out such motif
I remember well that day
When we were attacked in the USA


Today, half a decade later
I try to put in words what I remember
About the event that changed the world
On the 11th of September


The tear that I shed
Because of so much gloom and pain
I know it cannot be compared
To those who loved the slain


During a few days we all became one
Everyone together getting the job done
All because of that day
When people united in the USA
