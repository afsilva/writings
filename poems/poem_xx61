None of Us

To wake up and meditate
To grow up and alienate
To give up and extrapolate


A friend that is no longer present
A culture that is simply evanescent


All of us, neither of you
Among the saints of hypocrisy
And the landlords of taboo


The wants I fail to renounce
The salvation I fail to announce


Nothing new to show for
A museum, not a store
Needing mercy to adore
