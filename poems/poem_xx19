Ceased

If it ceased tonight
Would you call your departed father?
Would you drop your religious facade?
Would you hug your loving mother?


If it ceased tonight
Would you forget about your cares?
Would you quit your craft?
Would you fall into despair?


If it ceased tonight
Would you collect your possession?
Would you forgive your neighbor?
Would you treat it with discretion?


If it ceased tonight
Would you repent?
Would you believe?
Would you lament or be content?


I would give all I've earned away
'I love you,' would be all I'd say
To you, to my kids, to my wife
Because that's what matters in this life.
