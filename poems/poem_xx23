...read these words.


That is my understanding of faith
Why do I need four verses?
Why do I need to rhyme?
Why do I close my eyes?


Why do I need to buy?
Why do I need to sell?
Why do I need to write?


Why do I need grades?
Why do I need politicians?
Why do I need to say?


The ghost of ideas haunts me
Hoping that creativity would hide her face
Wondering if this is just a waste


When I want, You can’t stop me
But when You ask, I ignore
What I can’t hear or see


Could this be a prayer for the creative God
Whose love is deformed and amputated by me
I am not alone in this violent act of humanity


Instead of letting THIS LOVE reflect on us
Like the morning sunrays on a still pond
Our idea of LOVE is forced on everyone
Wearing the mask of Religion
Ready to go trick or treating


I guess I don’t need to know why
