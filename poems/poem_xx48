Just a Moon

Another day, another May
Another struggle just for pay


In a town with no lights
and a sky with no flights


Through the clouds, just a moon
all is forgotten in the afternoon


The reminder at night, in bed
tomorrow, try again, breakin' bread


A lover, a child, a friend or a stranger
following One born in that manger
