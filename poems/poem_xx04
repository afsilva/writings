I believe

Free me from my mind
Capture me now
Away from mankind
Fulfill your vow


Blind my eyes
From my lust
Let me see
Beyond reality’s dust


To the resting place
Carry my bones
Stuck on a dream
Cold as stone


Not feeling at all
Yet aware of you
Unable to reach out
Waiting for the rescue


I believe
I love
I doubt
sort of


I know you hear
I know you’re here
Is it enough?
To wipe my tear


Change in me what is old
Take away my precious gold
Replace its value and rarity
With attributes of charity
