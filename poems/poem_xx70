Meaning

If love is just a chemical in my skull
I couldn't imagine a life more dull
An accident of random proportion
The rape of meaning, an abortion


The right of the righteous is not always correct
Love's left us all wrong sometimes even inept
A war between the evidence of the unseen
Versus the blueprint of this Machine


If all we do is rotate around in space
Then maybe we are just here in a rat race
A race that nobody wins with no prize
Because before the end everybody dies


We may want to live until we die
But without meaning why even try?
Find your meaning and don't be mean
And life will be worth living in every single scene
