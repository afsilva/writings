Stone and Bone

Tomorrow is an unknown
It may never come
Today is a waste
Left undone
Yesterday is a memory
Forever gone


Tomorrow is possibility
Without hesitation
Today is a new day
With renewed motivation
Yesterday was
With great celebration


I see uncertainty
You see possibility
I see the plan
You see the end
I am petrified as stone
You are hopeful to the bone


Where do we go?
Whose heart will we follow?
Take it easy, and go slow?
Or take a deep breath and swallow?
