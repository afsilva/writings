A confession

I write this song
to confess
that I am nothing
when I can't express


my love for You
is a drop
compared to the ocean
of Your love


in the age of tolerance
We're arrogance
We don't seek anymore
We sell ourselves like a whore


I write this song
to express
that You are everything
when I confess


and when I fall
I am not alone
cause when I call
my wounds, You atone


in this song
I can't express
my love for You
and sins to confess
