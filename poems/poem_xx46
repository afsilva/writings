Mothers

Pain turns into joy
Through the eyes of the one
Who births a girl or a boy


The closest definition
Of unconditional love exists
On a mother's mission


To love
To protect
To nurture
To sacrifice
To deny herself


Too simple to understand
Too complex to explain
A mother holds her baby's hand


Undoubtedly important is the father
But no more than an intruder
Between a kid and her mother


A shield for toddlers
Rain that makes kids grow
Teaching us we'll reap what we sow


Lighthouse that guides the youth
Road paved with sweat and tears
Directing us towards a truth


Thank you, mother.
Thank your mother.
Thank you.






Author notes
Dedicated to my mother, Jane, and the mother of children, Joanna. The two most important women in my life.
