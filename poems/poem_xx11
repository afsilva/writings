Inspiration

I see Inspiration
She looks at me
Like Wisdom calling
in the street


I see Inspiration
When driving at night
Or just gazing at my wife
Even when it doesn’t rhyme


I close my eyes
And she is there
Standing still
Waiting for an affair


Outside the box
Inside my head
Words unlock
The road ahead


Path uncertain
I have never been
Trying to understand
And touch her skin
