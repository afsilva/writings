Yesterday, Today & Tomorrow

Yesterday, I was ready to win
Today, I am afraid of tomorrow
Tomorrow gets under my skin


Yesterday, I had all the answers
Today, I am full of questions
Tomorrow brings out all the cancers


Yesterday, I worked in vain
Today, I live the moment
Tomorrow is a drug, it's cocaine


Yesterday, I laughed, I cried
Today, I stand numb
Tomorrow is expected worldwide


Tomorrow will be the Today
We wasted Yesterday.
