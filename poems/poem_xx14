To her

Where would I be if it wasn’t for you
Would I still be there at home
Would I be happy or blue
Would anyone care would I be all alone


Maybe sitting on a bus watching life go by
Or Locked in a room staring at a screen
Waiting for real love with a sigh
Thinking about a feeling, an emotion so keen


What would I be if it wasn’t for you
Would I have made the same choices
Could there have been anything else true
Would you be able to hear my voice


Would I have made the same mistakes
Would you even know what you were missing
Would we’ve been exempt from other heartaches
Or maybe have the pleasure of kissing


Praises in awe cause the reality is
I am laying here beside you


And as you chase your dreams
Reflecting a precious sight


I kiss your forehead
and wish you a goodnight.
