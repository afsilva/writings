In the darkness
a blind man sees
In the light
a seeing man falls


I hear the rain coming down
People wandering around town
Kids being mistreated
Parents being neglected


Late at night
Or early in the morning?
What time is it?
Wake the dead, stop your mourning


Writings out of bounds
Balanced blurry thoughts
Embracing untouchable force
Tired eyelids’ fault


How many rhymes could there be
To express something within me
Weaken me so I can call upon You
Replace my heart as new


Is it really about winning?
I thought it was about a hand
A hand perforated by nails
A hand given to a friend


Do we believe be..cause we’re told
Or do we simply be..live on the events unfold


We are part of a greater story
That most of us don’t understand
Designed by the Author of glory
Hoping things will be fine at the end
