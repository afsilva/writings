Mine, Message, Medition

Silent sadness sits soaking in sorrow
Deadly danger drives a dad's desire
Calm conviction captures a child's care


False friend fakes a fiery faith
Ghastly grind of ghostly gloom
Peaceful premise of private property


We would willingly welcome wounded words
Thorns thrive through thoughts in threads
Lavish Latin lament living a lonely life


Beauty beyond belief
