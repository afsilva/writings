Am Not

I am not a poet
I am not a writer
I am not a thinker
I am not a fighter


I like to rhyme
while I write
and I'd like to think
I'll never fight


I am who you see
lost, overboard at sea
just trying to improvise
learning from the wise


Just a person incomplete
and broken by conceit


A believer
struggling
to live
