My Sanctuary

There is a place where I can be myself
A refuge for solitude, from a blessed life
A break from my mental hell


There, I am not a friend nor employed
There, I am not a father nor husband
There, I am just me fighting a void


Down one road, I might learn
On another, I may weep
Laugh during a U-turn
while passing a Jeep


There, I can pray and praise
With closed  eyes of mind
In reverence, yet alert in this maze


In my Sanctuary, I live in the secular
In my Sanctuary, I long the sacred
