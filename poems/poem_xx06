Don't do what I do

I might say
what you don’t know
You may hear
mumbling flow


Do what I say
Follow my way
Don’t argue with me
Try hard to see


Don’t do what I do
I can’t follow you
On my own ways
You are trying to stay


By now you’ve realized
That I am a fraud
Not to be idealized
Don’t need any applaud


I need to become
The student again
Please, Lord, rescue me
From a life so vain

Inspired by:
Well then, if you teach others, why don’t you teach yourself? You tell others not to steal, but do you steal? You say it is wrong to commit adultery, but do you do it? You condemn idolatry, but do you steal from pagan temples? You are so proud of knowing the law, but you dishonor God by breaking it. Romans 2:21-23 (NLT)
