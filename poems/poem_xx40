A tear

Expectation turns into disappointment
brought in by the digital carrier
Assurance turns into doubt
dismantling knowledge's barrier


Speechless, the word I'd say
if I could had said something
Anger, the feeling I'd feel
if I could had felt anything


Is it really worth that much to me?
It's not the price, but the cost.
Esteem of self
Thoughts of others
Wasted time
Failures of brothers


A tear
in my eye
A tear
in my heart


Life goes on
Time pauses to none
Head! Rise up!
And don't give up!
