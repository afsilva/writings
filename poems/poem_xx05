In a moment like this you come to haunt my mind
In the quiet of the night in the darkness of the room
You torment my spirit with arrows unligned
I lock my eyes, I guard the very heart you try to consume


I run towards Grace who is right behind me
I hear a whirl from wisdom’s hiding place
A bitter coldness breathes in the sigh I let out
Indifference. Apathy. Lethargy. Hollow wisdom’s tree.
You roar as a peaceful lamb pushing me towards Grace
I fall in the obscurity of a lost devout


Tonight, I am aware that I am losing a war
Senseless, callused by my own concept and thought
Tomorrow, I just hope You can pick me up off the floor
And that Grace will forgive my past and remember my wrought
