Now.

I don't mind knowing
I don't mind blame
I don't mind showing
I don't mind pain


Questioning the absolute
Denying arrogance
Ignoring the resolute




In years gone
Life is now.
In days to come
on broken vows


The solution is the problem
While we get to the bottom
The problem is unsolvable
And the end unstoppable
