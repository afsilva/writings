What can be done?

The cycle is ending once again
Self paused by overwhelming numbness
Not even a hint of pain


Noises all around
Surrounded by forced smiles
And unnatural behavior
Head and heart apart for miles


Fingertip production is zero
Having desires for nothing at all
Waiting for a hero
To call


What can be done?
To change the heart of one
To turn an idea into action
Drying up your mind from distraction


Soaking your heart with love
Starving your eyes from lust
Washing your hands with dust
Feeding your brain with none of the above


What can be done?
To rejuvenate the young


This, these and those
Maybe this would be better as prose


Is there nothing else to do in life?
Was it too much too soon without strife?


What can be done?
To make a journey meaningful
To make the road worth traveling


Some days the answer is clear
Other times impossible to steer
All that can be done is wait
And hope the next day will be great
