My Rio

Mountains embrace your land
Sun reflects your tan
Ocean touches your sky
Horizon is your apple’s eye


Day in Night falls
In the urban sprawl
Millions enchanted
By the beauty granted


Waves crawl your skin
Nature your lustful sin
Sand paves your feet
Jungle made of concrete


Theme of song
Place I long
Pride of nation
Land of vacation


Redeemer watches
standing still


Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
