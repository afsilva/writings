life is broken
yet worth living
miracle unspoken


unfair by sabotage
she's precious by design
we're her entourage


E.ternal
L.ovely
L.ittle
A.mazing


gift from heaven
hope transcending
our perfect number seven


simple child
in her daddy's arms
safe, tender, mild


I don't know you
but I've met you
love will see you through


eternal
lovely
little
amazing


baby.
