Where is it?

No where to be seen
No where to intervene
Now here to be praised
Now here and amazed


There is no love
If we live
for the enemy
in a dichotomy


Some will say
While in the grey
Deny yourself
Leaving love on a shelf


Assert your belief
Kill the thief
Love your brother
The rest don't bother


Hard to lament
Failure to augment
When love talks
But never walks
