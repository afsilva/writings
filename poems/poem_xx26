Dichotomic Love

To truly love
Is to vanquish reason
To truly trust
Is to denounce treason


To understand love
One must know hate
To trust love
One must know fate


On Earth
Love divides
In Heaven
Love unites


Outward love
Steady and calm
Inward love
A beautiful psalm


Love as we know
Divided by two
Remainder of one
Whose love is true
