words of a friend
poured out like rain
hoping for an end
impartial to any saint
words not spoken
written while broken
query of faith
in a disabled embrace
words bloomed in your field
no paper
no pencil
just an odorless shield
words have to express
the absence of light
in this cluttered mess
we call life
