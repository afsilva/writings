Return On Investment

Why do I wait for some return?
Everything I thought, the nothing I felt
My calloused heart needs to melt


For a whole week I wept weakly
Hunted by a ghost of a prayer
Laughing at me during the scare


If I abide by you
Will you give me your hand?
If I abide in you
Can I see the promise land?


I free fall in uncertainty
Hoping to bear any fruit
Instead I flirt with insanity
Thinking about a better repute


Your will targets me from above
While expecting a call
From the one who ignores love
And misses the point of all


Faith whispers in my ear
I run towards her embrace
Knowing that she always here


In the end, I hope to hear a voice
Strong and loud as thunder
Announcing I made the right choice
And there is no more need to wonder
