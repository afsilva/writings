It Came Upon A Midnight Clear

It is cold and dark tonight
I don't know if I will make till sunrise
No water, no food, no rest for days
Lost and alone in this sanded haze


The rockets and bombs I can still hear
From the enemy troops I assume are near
Defending my country, I came and fought here
Now, soon my loved ones will face their greatest fear


I look at the sky and notice a light
Is this it? Will this be my end tonight?
I say a prayer while reflecting upon my past
My God! I am ready to meet you at last


It's midnight and the light is brighter than before
I close my eyes and forfeit this war...


That's all I remember
from that 25th of December
The light was not my end
It was a helicopter bringing me mend
