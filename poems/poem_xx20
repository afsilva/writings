Unconsciousness

Is a flower aware of its beauty?
Is a storm aware of its strength?
Does the moon know it inspires romance?
And sunset tells us about another chance.




Are the birds mindful of the songs they sing?
Has anyone notified dogs they are men’s best friends?
Do children realize what blessing they are?
And we can reach our destination by following a star.


My unconscious is someone I’d like to meet
Become aware of my influence
The me, who I am, whom I am not aware of
The real me without masks and unfaithful love.
