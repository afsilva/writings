God's Promise by Sean Silva

God has a promise
That he will never break.
We all know that because
God is not a fake.
Everyone should believe in
Him for our own sake.


His promise to us is that
We will have a Saviour
Who can free us from all sin
And he was born in a bin
Called a manger.


Jesus is his name
And he came
For us to forgive
All of our sins.


He will win battles
And when the earth rattles
We will rejoice
With our voice
That he will reign
Even through all our pain.
