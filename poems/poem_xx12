Everything is nothing

So much
Yet so little
Everything
But nothing to show
Fulfilled desires
And an empty soul


Knowledge
Experience
No wisdom


Full
Yet hungry
Entertained
But not amuzed
Plenty to do
And no will through


Smile
Frown


Words
Without actions
Fear
And afraid


Here still
Agitated all the time
Free
In a prison


Expressing anything
about nothing
which is everything
to no onne


Swimming
in the clear
dark waters
of life
