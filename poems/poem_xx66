from a mother
it is our first
as a child
cooties and disgust


to our savior
it was a greeting
full of greed
by a traitor


in our teens
the thing
we desired
in our dreams

to love
a commitment
between two nude

a grandma
may charge
for advice


a loving gesture 
sought by all
enough evidence
of a relationship's texture


kiss
is
a
bliss
