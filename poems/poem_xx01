Life picture

Cold as ice
Scared as mice
Alone as one
Too tired to run


Where do I go
Who can I tell
When will be over
This pleasant hell


Eye to an eye
No cheek to turn
Blind ally
Helping me burn


Sad song
Short verse
Crowded alone
and logically perverse


Too much noise
Black and white
Awkward poise
Under the light


Life is a picture
standing still
Life is a movie
rolling downhilll
