Digital Pain

In the bright plane I stare
The display of information
Brought and sent from everywhere
To and from my workstation


Yes, the one I always say
No, the zero I can’t stand
Maybe, humans. Are they
Undestanding a single command?


Monochromatic intelligence
Colorful efficiency machine
Solution. Problem. Aberrance.
Addictive as caffeine


The virtual place to play
The real place to be
Challenging society’s array
Even replacing the TV


Unable us to think for ourselves
Making us lazy and bored
Ignoring the books on the shelves
Posting on the bulletin board
