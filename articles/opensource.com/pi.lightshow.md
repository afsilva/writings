Last Thanksgiving, I took some time off from work and was looking for a fun project to work on during my downtime. I decided to [check out](http://anderson.the-silvas.com/2014/11/26/having-fun-with-the-raspberry-pi-b/) Raspberry Pi. After a quick search on Amazon, I ordered the [CanaKit Raspberry Pi B+ Ultimate Starter Kit](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Ultimate-Starter-Components/dp/B00G1PNG54/ref=sr_1_1).

The kit arrived the Friday before Thanksgiving, and I wasted no time getting to work. I didn't need another computer running Linux at home, so my interest in the Raspberry Pi focused on what its hardware could offer that my laptops couldn't.

When I unboxed the kit and saw all the LEDs and wires that came with it, the first thing that came to mind was [Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4PaB4TenH4) at Disney's Hollywood Studios. I had no idea if I'd be able to get the Pi to light up any of those LEDs, but if I could just understand how to make software interact with hardware at this level, my investment would be worth it.

First, being completely biased to anything Fedora or Red Hat-based, I decided to use [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/introducing-noobs/) to install [Pidora](http://pidora.ca/). But as cool as the Fedora spinoff was, I quickly realized it wasn't the Linux distribution I needed to make my Christmas light show.

I went with the Raspberry Pi's recommendation and installed [Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org/). It quickly proved itself to be the better distribution for the job for a few reasons:

1.  [raspi\_config](http://elinux.org/RPi_raspi-config) allowed me to do quite a bit of configuration changes to the Raspberry Pi right off the bat.
2.  Raspbian's out-of-the-box needed about 50 percent less memory than Pidora, which is HUGE for a little piece of hardware that has 512 MB!
3.  It came with [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/raspberry-pi/), [Scratch](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-scratch/), [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/), and the Python libraries I needed to do some coding with the GPIO pins.
4.  The Raspberry Pi [book](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-User-Guide-Eben-Upton/dp/1118921666/) (and foundation) recommend Raspbian, so I had two places to look for guidance and examples.

By Friday night, I had the Pi connected to my TV and Wi-Fi. With Raspbian installed, I ran an: `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` to update the OS and was ready to dive in to all the extras that came with the kit.

I had learned a little about electricity in high school and college, but never really had a chance to apply that knowledge anywhere else. Terms like "breadboard," "jumper wires," "resistors," "current," and "voltage" weren't foreign to me, but I had very little hands-on experience with them. So, what did I do? Googled them!

First, I used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9jcHB9tWko) to learn about the breadboard, LEDs, and resistors. I then applied that concept to the CanaKit. Here's a video with a quick video I made of how I put it all together:

Now that I had the lights working, the next step was making the LEDs "listen to music" and blink accordingly?

With another Google search and I found an awesome open source project called: [LightshowPi](https://bitbucket.org/togiles/lightshowpi/wiki/Home). I quickly realized that the idea of an Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights of my own wasn't such a silly idea after all. After joining the LightshowPi [Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/101789596301454731630), I read up on a few tips and tricks for setting up my very own light show.

I went ahead and ordered the next part of the puzzle: a [Sainsmart eight-channel 5V solid state relay (SSR) module board](http://www.sainsmart.com/8-channel-5v-solid-state-relay-module-board-omron-ssr-4-pic-arm-avr-dsp-arduino.html). It took a couple of weeks to arrive at my doorstep, but when it did I went to the store right away to buy the rest of the materials I needed for my light show.

Once I tested the connection with the board, it was time for me hook up the Christmas lights I was going to put on my Christmas tree. The final result was simply one of the most satisfyingly geeky things I have ever done. For most of December, I left my Raspberry Pi connected to my Christmas tree. With a simple SSH client on my phone, I could easily start/stop the show any time I wanted.

Here's the final result:

Below is a comprehensive set of steps you can take to make your own:

1.  Watch the breadboard [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9jcHB9tWko).
2.  Watch my canakit [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzzdyzDdMKU).
3.  Once you are comfortable with that, look at the [LightshowPi](https://bitbucket.org/togiles/lightshowpi/wiki/Home) project. Learn how to use it. [Here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzF9u41EgCU) of the LEDs being controlled by LightshowPi.
4.  Join LightshowPi's [Google+ community](https://plus.google.com/communities/101789596301454731630), read up the projects and photos there.
5.  Once you've done all that and understand what's going, order the [Sainsmart eight-channel 5V solid state relay module board](http://www.sainsmart.com/8-channel-5v-solid-state-relay-module-board-omron-ssr-4-pic-arm-avr-dsp-arduino.html). (mine took two weeks to arrive)
6.  Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2B67hybdAA) on how to connect your Raspberry Pi to the SSR board.
7.  Purchase six polarized extension cords at Target: five for the light string and one for the power source. I only used five of the eight channels on the SSR board.
8.  Following this [step-by-step guide](https://plus.google.com/photos/100867431155529957394/albums/6085653216891072897), cut the wires and daisy chain the power source into the relay, and that's it!

Note: Make sure you have something to cut the wires with, a small screwdriver to tighten the SSR board slots, electrical tape, and a jackknife.
