Running Quake 3 and 4 on Fedora 12 (64-bit)
===========================================

**By [Anderson Silva](../authors/silva.html)**

I started writing this article one night in December when I was bored and looking for a game to play on Linux. I am not much of a computer gamer, so I am not really current with what is out there for games in the Open Source world. That night I stumbled across [OpenArena](http://openarena.ws/ "OpenArena"), which is "a network enabled multiplayer first person shooter based on the ioquake3 fork of the id tech 3 engine." \[[1](http://openarena.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page "1")\]

I installed OpenArena on my Fedora 12 x86\_64 install (i.e. yum install openarena), and played it for a few minutes. That's how long it took for me to travel back in time and have the urge to play some good-old Quake 3 Arena. I purchased my very own copy of 'Quake 3 Arena for Linux' back in December of 1999 when it was released. Do you remember [Loki Games](http://www.lokigames.com/ "Loki Game")? \[**Note**: Can you believe that this game is now over 10 years old?!\]

I decided then to dig up my old Quake 3 CD, and see if it would still run on my 'shiny' Fedora 12 x86\_64 install. At first, I got all sorts of errors, I couldn't install it from the original CD, nor by downloading the most recent binaries from ID Software, which believe it or not, is already 6 years old.

Anyway, I was able to get Quake 3 running on my Lenovo Thinkpad T500 (Intel Graphics Card) running Fedora 12 x86\_64, and here's what I had to do:

### Installation:

**1.** Grab the two latest updates from ID Software's FTP: [Q3A Point Release 1.32b](ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake3/linux/linuxq3apoint-1.32b-3.x86.run) and [Q3A Point Release 1.32c](ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake3/quake3-1.32c.zip)

wget ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake3/linux/linuxq3apoint-1.32b-3.x86.run
wget ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake3/quake3-1.32c.zip

**2.** Then make linuxq3apoint-1.32b-3.x86.run executable:

chmod 755 linuxq3apoint-1.32b-3.x86.run

**3.** Execute it:

linux32 ./linuxq3apoint-1.32b-3.x86.run

\[**Note**: _linux32_ tells Linux to execute linuxq3apoint-1.32b-3.x86.run with CPU architecture set to 32 bit\]

**4.** Unzip 1.32c, and copy over the binaries under the 'linux' directory to /usr/local/games/quake3:

unzip quake3-1.32c.zip
cp Quake III Arena 1.32c/linux/\* /usr/local/games/quake3/

**5.** Grab your original Quake 3 Arena CD, and copy over the base3q files to /usr/local/games/quake3/base3q/

\[**Note**: This will work with an original Quake 3 Arena CD for Linux or Windows\]

### Fixing Sound:

Before you even try to start up the game, I can tell you right now the sound will be broken; here's how to fix it. Quake 3 Arena needs the /dev/dsp device to be present on the file system:

**1.** As root:

/sbin/modprobe snd\_pcm\_oss

\[**Note**: This is non-persistent, through this module /dev/dsp is created\]

**2.** Set permissions:

chmod 777 /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss

### Starting the game:

Now we are ready to give Quake 3 Arena a try, but before you can even execute the binary, there are a couple of things you need to be aware of:

**1.** Need to pass some parameters to the kernel so sound will work.  
**2.** Need to execute the binary under the 32-bit architecture.

echo "quake3-smp.x86 0 0 direct" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss && linux32 /usr/local/games/quake3/quake3-smp

\[**Note**: I am running the SMP binary, since my laptop has 2 cores. If you run on a single processor, you will need to run\]

echo "quake3.x86 0 0 direct" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss && linux32 /usr/local/games/quake3/quake3

![](misc/silva/EXTERN_0001.png)

### Troubleshooting Tips:

**1.**If your game freezes seconds after starting a match, use '+set s\_musicvolume -1' when starting the game.  
**2.** If the sound still not working after setting the parameter above: Open your 'Sound Preferences' under GNOME and under the Hardware tab, change the profile from Analog to Digital... it did the trick for me.  
**3\.** If you are using nvidia cards:

yum install xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-libs-32bit # from rpmfusion.org

**4\.** Make sure that modules like 'glx' are being loaded in the xorg.conf file.

Quake 4
-------

After a few hours of playing Quake 3 on my laptop, I decided to take one step further and try to get Quake 4 working on Fedora 12. And to my surprise it actually took me longer to figure out how to get Quake 4 working than it took for Quake 3.

![](misc/silva/dgqqst99_56fd5j3cck_b.jpg)

### Installation

**1.** Grab the latest Quake 4 binaries from ID Software. [quake4-linux-1.4.2.x86.run](ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake4/linux/quake4-linux-1.4.2.x86.run).

wget ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake4/linux/quake4-linux-1.4.2.x86.run

**2\.** Then make _quake4-linux-1.4.2.x86.run_ executable:

chmod 755 quake4-linux-1.4.2.x86.run

**3.** Execute it:

linux32 ./quake4-linux-1.4.2.x86.run

**4.** Copy the the baseq4 files from your original Windows CDs (or DVD) to /usr/local/games/quake4/base4q  
**5\.** When I tried to execute the binary with:

linux32 /usr/local/games/quake4/quake4-smp

I would get an error like this:

  X..GL\_EXT\_texture\_compression\_s3tc not found

After several hours of 'googling' and reading documentation, I was able to to fix this problem by doing the following:

yum install driconf

Then, as the user who will be running the game, run:

driconf

and under Image Quality, enable _S3TC textures_. That did it for me.

![](misc/silva/EXTERN_0002.png)

### Fixing Sound:

**1.** As root:

/sbin/modprobe snd\_pcm\_oss
chmod 777 /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss

**2\.** My game still didn't have sound, so I had to edit _~/.quake4/q4base/Quake4Config.cfg_ and modify the option from:

seta s\_driver "best"

to

seta s\_driver "oss"

### Starting the game:

And finally, much like how we started Quake 3 Arena, we may now start up Quake 4:

echo "quake4-smp.x86 0 0 direct" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss && linux32 /usr/local/games/quake4/quake4-smp

![](misc/silva/EXTERN_0003.png)

### Conclusion:

If you have been around Linux for over ten years and used to play these 'classic' games back in the day, I hope you enjoy getting them re-installed and running again on your systems as much as I have. If you have just started using Linux within the past few years, and you don't have the original media to install Quake 3 Arena or Quake 4, stick around with OpenArena. It's a great alternative to the Quake saga, and it's much easier to install.
